# Student Scores Analysis

This Python script performs analysis on student scores from a CSV file (`student_scores_random_names.csv`). It utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. The script includes several functions to identify students who failed subjects, calculate average scores, and generate visual representations of the data.

## Requirements

To run this script, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `openpyxl` (for saving Excel files)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
